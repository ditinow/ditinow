### Hi there üëã
<p>Welcom to DiTiNOW, a NFT based anti-counterfeiting solution. The goal of DiTiNOW project is to provide a low cost, low latency and easy to use anti-counterfeiting solutions for consumers and brand owners.  </p>

<p>Counterfeiting is a "double spending" problem of real world assets. It is not acitvity of an asset being sold multiple times, instead it is the AUTHORIZATION of the asset being fake or replicated. A product authroized by brand owners must be genuine, however a genuine product may not be authorized. Overruns by OEM factory, defective, damaged, stolen, contaminated,expired goods are examples of real/genuine but nor authorized products. </p>

<p>Traditional definition of counterfeit goods are fake or replica of real product. This definition limits our vision on how to fight against counterfeiting.  The focus has to shift from what is "real/genuine" to what is "authorized". (By tradition definition, counterfeit goods is neither genuine nor authorized.) </p>

<p>The latest approach to prevent counterfeiting is blockchain based, decentralized, distributed title recording protocol. Brand owners can uses this protocol to tokenize AUTHORIZATION into NFT for every item they authorize to built or sell. Consumers can verify the source of authroization and legitimate owners of an authorized product simply by few touches on thier smart phone. System built on this protocol featuring low cost, low latency and privacy protecting, thanks to blockchain technology and NFT. We would likt to call this new type of title recording protocol as <b>Di</b>gital <b>Ti</b>tle, thus the the project name DiTiNOW come from. </p>

<p>The solution of includes:
                      <ul>
                        <li>A web based application <a href="http://cryptoc14.com" target="_blank">CryptoC14</a> (for demostration please visit <a href="diti/en/" target="_blank">DiTiNOW.com/diti</a>)</li>
                        <li>A POS public blockchain (CC14 chain)</li>
                        <li>HTTP service is needed for distributing title token (aka NFT, acting as certification of authenticity/ownership) and providing non-transactional information, such as product information and designated wallet information.</li>
                      </ul>
